/* Native replacements of original routines (phase 3).
 *
 * Each entry binds a C function to a code address (normally 0050:xxxx). When the CPU is
 * about to execute an instruction at an enabled entry's address, the C function runs
 * instead. It sees the full CPU state and must leave it exactly as the original routine
 * would on return, including popping the return address (native_ret / native_retf).
 * A native call costs the entry's `cycles` (NATIVE_CALL_CYCLES if 0) emulated cycles.
 * Charging what the original takes keeps the emulated timeline, and so the screen,
 * identical; --verify reports the original's measured cycle range for that purpose.
